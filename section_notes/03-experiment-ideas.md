# Experiment Ideas

## Overview

This experimental program systematically tests our core hypothesis that strategically minimal, actionability-focused AI systems can outperform comprehensive, accuracy-optimized approaches for rare disease drug repurposing. Each experiment directly challenges fundamental assumptions in the literature through controlled comparative studies.

Our experimental strategy follows a three-stage approach:
1. **Assumption Validation**: Test each literature assumption independently
2. **System Comparison**: Compare flipped approaches against traditional methods
3. **Clinical Translation**: Validate real-world implementation benefits

## Planned Experiments

### Experiment 1: Data Minimalism vs. Data Maximalism
- **Objective**: Test whether strategically minimal datasets outperform comprehensive multi-modal approaches for rare disease drug repurposing
- **Hypothesis**: Curated minimal datasets will achieve superior actionable predictions compared to large, noisy multi-modal datasets
- **Methodology**: 
  - Select 10 rare diseases with varying data availability
  - Create minimal datasets (high-confidence molecular targets + curated literature)
  - Compile maximal datasets (transcriptomics + proteomics + chemical + clinical + literature)
  - Train identical model architectures on both dataset types
  - Evaluate on held-out rare disease repurposing tasks
- **Independent Variables**: Dataset type (minimal vs. maximal), disease category, data quality metrics
- **Dependent Variables**: Prediction accuracy, actionability score, expert agreement, time-to-actionable-insight
- **Expected Outcomes**: Minimal datasets will show higher actionability scores despite potentially lower raw accuracy
- **Success Metrics**: >15% improvement in expert actionability ratings, <50% of maximal dataset size, maintained predictive performance
- **Validity Threats**: Selection bias in data curation, domain-specific effects
- **Mitigations**: Blinded expert evaluation, cross-disease validation, systematic curation protocols

### Experiment 2: Actionability-First vs. Accuracy-First Model Design
- **Objective**: Determine if AI systems optimized for clinical actionability outperform accuracy-optimized models in real-world scenarios
- **Hypothesis**: Models designed for interpretability and uncertainty quantification will produce better clinical decisions than accuracy-maximized models
- **Methodology**:
  - Develop two model variants: accuracy-optimized (complex ensemble) vs. actionability-optimized (interpretable + uncertainty)
  - Create standardized clinical decision scenarios for rare disease repurposing
  - Conduct blinded evaluation with rare disease clinicians
  - Measure decision quality, confidence, and implementation likelihood
- **Independent Variables**: Model design philosophy, clinician experience level, disease complexity
- **Dependent Variables**: Clinical decision quality, implementation likelihood, clinician confidence, time-to-decision
- **Expected Outcomes**: Actionability-first models will achieve higher implementation rates and clinician confidence
- **Success Metrics**: >20% higher implementation likelihood, >25% improvement in clinician confidence scores
- **Validity Threats**: Clinician bias, scenario realism, model complexity confounds
- **Mitigations**: Randomized clinician assignment, validated clinical scenarios, controlled complexity matching

### Experiment 3: Cross-Disease Transfer Learning Validation
- **Objective**: Test whether shared mechanistic patterns across rare diseases can be leveraged through meta-learning approaches
- **Hypothesis**: Transfer learning across rare diseases will outperform disease-specific models, especially for ultra-rare conditions
- **Methodology**:
  - Identify mechanistic similarity clusters among 50+ rare diseases
  - Train meta-learning models on cross-disease patterns
  - Compare against disease-specific baselines
  - Test generalization to novel rare diseases with minimal data
- **Independent Variables**: Disease similarity metrics, training set composition, meta-learning architecture
- **Dependent Variables**: Generalization performance, data efficiency, novel disease prediction accuracy
- **Expected Outcomes**: Meta-learning will excel for diseases with <100 training examples
- **Success Metrics**: >30% improvement for ultra-rare diseases, successful generalization to 5+ novel diseases
- **Validity Threats**: Disease heterogeneity, similarity metric validity, overfitting to common patterns
- **Mitigations**: Multiple similarity metrics, leave-disease-out validation, mechanistic validation

### Experiment 4: Parallel vs. Sequential Validation Strategies
- **Objective**: Evaluate whether parallel validation using real-world evidence can accelerate repurposing without compromising safety
- **Hypothesis**: Parallel validation protocols will reduce time-to-treatment while maintaining safety standards
- **Methodology**:
  - Design parallel validation protocol combining computational prediction + real-world evidence analysis + expedited preclinical testing
  - Compare against traditional sequential validation timeline
  - Simulate validation pathways for 20 candidate drug-disease pairs
  - Analyze safety outcomes and timeline benefits
- **Independent Variables**: Validation strategy, disease urgency level, available real-world evidence
- **Dependent Variables**: Time-to-clinical-trial, safety signal detection, validation confidence, resource requirements
- **Expected Outcomes**: 40-60% reduction in validation timeline with maintained safety
- **Success Metrics**: >40% timeline reduction, equivalent safety signal detection, maintained regulatory acceptance
- **Validity Threats**: Regulatory acceptance, safety equivalence assumptions, resource availability
- **Mitigations**: Regulatory consultation, safety benchmarking, resource constraint modeling

### Experiment 5: Human-AI Collaboration vs. Full Automation
- **Objective**: Determine if collaborative human-AI systems outperform fully automated approaches for complex repurposing decisions
- **Hypothesis**: Hybrid systems that amplify clinical expertise will achieve better outcomes than fully automated AI
- **Methodology**:
  - Develop collaborative interface allowing expert-AI iterative refinement
  - Compare hybrid decision-making against fully automated predictions
  - Test with experienced rare disease clinicians on complex cases
  - Measure decision quality, novel insights, and implementation success
- **Independent Variables**: Decision-making approach, case complexity, expert experience level
