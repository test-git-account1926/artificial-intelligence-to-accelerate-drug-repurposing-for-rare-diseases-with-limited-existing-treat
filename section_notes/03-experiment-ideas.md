# Experiment Ideas

## Overview

Our experimental approach follows Computer Science-inspired research methodology to test fundamental assumptions in AI-driven drug repurposing for rare diseases. We design controlled experiments that challenge five literature-level assumptions through systematic comparison of traditional vs. assumption-flipped approaches. Each experiment is structured with clear hypotheses, measurable outcomes, and validity controls to ensure rigorous scientific evaluation.

**Experimental Strategy**: We employ a three-phase approach following the assumption + hypothesis paradigm:
1. **Assumption Validation**: Systematically test whether literature-level assumptions actually hold under controlled conditions
2. **Hypothesis Testing**: Validate that our assumption inversions lead to measurably superior outcomes  
3. **Vectoring**: Continuously identify the highest-risk assumptions that could invalidate our entire approach

**AI Agent Execution Framework**: All experiments are designed to be executable by AI agents with access to computational resources, datasets, and model training capabilities. Each experiment includes specific automation protocols, success/failure criteria, and iterative refinement mechanisms.

## Planned Experiments

### Experiment 1: Data Minimalism vs. Data Maximalism
- **Core Research Question**: Does the assumption that "more data always improves AI predictions" hold for rare disease drug repurposing?
- **Literature Assumption**: Data Maximalism Assumption - comprehensive multi-modal datasets always improve repurposing predictions

### Experiment 2: Actionability-First vs. Accuracy-First AI Design
- **Core Research Question**: Is predictive accuracy the right optimization target for clinical AI systems?
- **Literature Assumption**: Accuracy-First Assumption - predictive accuracy (AUC, precision, recall) is the primary success metric for medical AI systems
- **Assumption Flip**: Clinical actionability metrics (interpretability, uncertainty, decision support) are more important than raw accuracy

### Experiment 3: Cross-Disease Transfer Learning vs. Disease-Specific Models

### Experiment 4: Parallel vs. Sequential Validation Strategies

- **Assumption Flip**: Parallel multi-stage validation using real-world evidence and computational modeling can achieve equivalent safety validation faster
- **Hypothesis Claim Type**: X ≥ Y (parallel validation maintains safety standards) + Bounding X (parallel validation works under specific risk tolerance conditions)

**Vectoring Analysis**:

- **Phase 3**: Deploy integration experiments (4, 5, 9, 10) to validate deployment and collaboration assumptions
- **Phase 4**: Meta-analysis across all experiments to identify synergistic assumption flips and optimal combinations

### Enhanced AI Agent Execution Protocol

**Automated Experiment Orchestration**:
- **Priority Queue**: Continuously re-rank experiments by assumption invalidation risk and field impact potential
- **Resource Allocation**: Dynamically assign computational resources based on experiment complexity and learning rate
- **Early Stopping**: Implement Bayesian sequential testing with automated experiment termination when evidence threshold reached
- **Adaptive Follow-up**: Automatically generate targeted follow-up experiments based on unexpected results

**Real-Time Vectoring Dashboard**:
- **Assumption Risk Tracking**: Monitor which core assumptions show highest vulnerability across experiments
- **Learning Rate Optimization**: Track information gain per computational resource across different experimental approaches
- **Synergy Detection**: Identify assumption flips that show synergistic effects when combined
- **Field Impact Modeling**: Estimate potential field-wide impact if each assumption flip is validated

### Publication and Field Impact Strategy

**Multi-Paper Portfolio**:
- **Paper 1**: "Data Minimalism in AI Drug Repurposing" (Experiments 1, 6 results)
- **Paper 2**: "Beyond Accuracy: Clinical Actionability in Medical AI" (Experiments 2, 8, 10 results)
- **Paper 3**: "Mechanistic AI vs. Pattern Matching for Drug Discovery" (Experiments 3, 7 results)
- **Paper 4**: "Human-AI Collaboration Paradigms for Rare Disease Treatment" (Experiments 4, 5, 9 results)
- **Paper 5**: "Meta-Analysis: Assumption Networks in AI Drug Repurposing" (Cross-experiment synthesis)

**Expected Field-Level Impact**:
