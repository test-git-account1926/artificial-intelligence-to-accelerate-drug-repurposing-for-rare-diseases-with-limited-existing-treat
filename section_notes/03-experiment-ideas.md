# Experiment Ideas

## Overview

Our experimental approach follows Computer Science-inspired research methodology to test fundamental assumptions in AI-driven drug repurposing for rare diseases. We design controlled experiments that challenge five literature-level assumptions through systematic comparison of traditional vs. assumption-flipped approaches. Each experiment is structured with clear hypotheses, measurable outcomes, and validity controls to ensure rigorous scientific evaluation.

**Experimental Strategy**: We employ a three-phase approach following the assumption + hypothesis paradigm:
1. **Assumption Validation**: Systematically test whether literature-level assumptions actually hold under controlled conditions
2. **Hypothesis Testing**: Validate that our assumption inversions lead to measurably superior outcomes  
3. **Vectoring**: Continuously identify the highest-risk assumptions that could invalidate our entire approach

**AI Agent Execution Framework**: All experiments are designed to be executable by AI agents with access to computational resources, datasets, and model training capabilities. Each experiment includes specific automation protocols, success/failure criteria, and iterative refinement mechanisms.

## Planned Experiments

### Experiment 1: Data Minimalism vs. Data Maximalism
- **Core Research Question**: Does the assumption that "more data always improves AI predictions" hold for rare disease drug repurposing?
- **Literature Assumption**: Data Maximalism Assumption - comprehensive multi-modal datasets always improve repurposing predictions

### Experiment 2: Actionability-First vs. Accuracy-First AI Design
- **Core Research Question**: Is predictive accuracy the right optimization target for clinical AI systems?
- **Literature Assumption**: Accuracy-First Assumption - predictive accuracy (AUC, precision, recall) is the primary success metric for medical AI systems
- **Assumption Flip**: Clinical actionability metrics (interpretability, uncertainty, decision support) are more important than raw accuracy

### Experiment 3: Cross-Disease Transfer Learning vs. Disease-Specific Models
