# Experiment Ideas

## Overview

Our experimental approach follows Computer Science-inspired research methodology to test fundamental assumptions in AI-driven drug repurposing for rare diseases. We design controlled experiments that challenge five literature-level assumptions through systematic comparison of traditional vs. assumption-flipped approaches. Each experiment is structured with clear hypotheses, measurable outcomes, and validity controls to ensure rigorous scientific evaluation.

**Experimental Strategy**: We employ a three-phase approach following the assumption + hypothesis paradigm:
1. **Assumption Validation**: Systematically test whether literature-level assumptions actually hold under controlled conditions
2. **Hypothesis Testing**: Validate that our assumption inversions lead to measurably superior outcomes  
3. **Vectoring**: Continuously identify the highest-risk assumptions that could invalidate our entire approach

**AI Agent Execution Framework**: All experiments are designed to be executable by AI agents with access to computational resources, datasets, and model training capabilities. Each experiment includes specific automation protocols, success/failure criteria, and iterative refinement mechanisms.

## Planned Experiments

### Experiment 1: Data Minimalism vs. Data Maximalism
- **Core Research Question**: Does the assumption that "more data always improves AI predictions" hold for rare disease drug repurposing?
- **Literature Assumption**: Data Maximalism Assumption - comprehensive multi-modal datasets always improve repurposing predictions
- **Assumption Flip**: Strategically minimal, high-signal datasets can outperform comprehensive multi-modal approaches
- **Hypothesis Claim Type**: X > Y (minimal curated data outperforms comprehensive multi-modal data)

**Vectoring Analysis**:
- **Highest Risk**: If data quality doesn't matter and more data always wins, our entire minimalist approach fails
- **Invalidation Test**: Run with progressively smaller datasets - if performance degrades linearly, assumption holds
- **Impact Validation**: Success would affect entire field of biomedical AI data collection strategies

- **Assumption Invalidated**: If failure occurs, pivot to investigating optimal data size thresholds

**Automated Vectoring Checks**:

- If results are mixed, automatically generate sub-experiments testing different minimalism strategies
- Track computational efficiency as secondary validation of practical utility

### Experiment 2: Actionability-First vs. Accuracy-First AI Design
- **Core Research Question**: Is predictive accuracy the right optimization target for clinical AI systems?
- **Literature Assumption**: Accuracy-First Assumption - predictive accuracy (AUC, precision, recall) is the primary success metric for medical AI systems
- **Assumption Flip**: Clinical actionability metrics (interpretability, uncertainty, decision support) are more important than raw accuracy
- **Hypothesis Claim Type**: X > Y (actionability-optimized models produce better clinical outcomes than accuracy-optimized models)

**Vectoring Analysis**:
- **Highest Risk**: If accuracy strongly correlates with clinical utility, actionability features may be irrelevant overhead
- **Invalidation Test**: Compare models with identical accuracy but different actionability - if outcomes identical, assumption holds

- **Moderate Success**: Actionability model shows >15% better clinical outcomes with <5% accuracy loss
- **Failure**: No difference in clinical outcomes or accuracy dramatically more important
- **Assumption Invalidated**: If pure accuracy wins, investigate whether interpretability can be achieved without sacrificing accuracy

**Automated Vectoring Checks**:
- Monitor accuracy-utility correlation - if r>0.9, pivot to investigating accuracy-preserving actionability methods
- Track prediction confidence calibration - poorly calibrated uncertainty invalidates approach
- Measure computational overhead - if >3x slower, investigate efficiency-actionability tradeoffs

### Experiment 3: Cross-Disease Transfer Learning vs. Disease-Specific Models
- **Core Research Question**: Do rare diseases require unique computational approaches or do they share exploitable patterns?
- **Literature Assumption**: Disease-Specific Modeling Assumption - each rare disease requires custom computational approaches due to unique pathophysiology
- **Assumption Flip**: Shared mechanistic patterns across rare diseases can be leveraged through meta-learning approaches
- **Hypothesis Claim Type**: X > Y (cross-disease transfer learning outperforms disease-specific models) + Bounding X (transfer learning particularly effective for ultra-rare conditions)

**Vectoring Analysis**:
- **Highest Risk**: If diseases are truly unique, transfer learning will show negative transfer and perform worse
- **Invalidation Test**: Measure performance vs. training data size - if transfer doesn't help with small datasets, assumption holds

**Success/Failure Criteria**:
- **Strong Success**: Transfer learning achieves >40% better performance on ultra-rare diseases (n<100)
- **Moderate Success**: Transfer learning shows >25% improvement on low-data diseases with faster convergence
- **Failure**: No improvement or negative transfer occurs across disease types
- **Assumption Invalidated**: If failure, investigate whether disease clustering by mechanism enables better transfer

**Automated Vectoring Checks**:
- Monitor negative transfer rate - if >30% of diseases show worse performance, halt and investigate disease similarity metrics
- Track convergence speed - if transfer learning doesn't converge faster than disease-specific, reconsider approach
- Evaluate few-shot learning curves - if no improvement with <50 samples, assumption about ultra-rare diseases may be wrong

### Experiment 4: Parallel vs. Sequential Validation Strategies
- **Core Research Question**: Must drug validation follow linear preclinical-to-clinical stages, or can parallel approaches achieve equivalent safety?
- **Literature Assumption**: Sequential Validation Assumption - drug safety validation must follow linear preclinical → Phase I → Phase II progression for risk management
- **Assumption Flip**: Parallel multi-stage validation using real-world evidence and computational modeling can achieve equivalent safety validation faster
- **Hypothesis Claim Type**: X ≥ Y (parallel validation maintains safety standards) + Bounding X (parallel validation works under specific risk tolerance conditions)

**Vectoring Analysis**:
- **Highest Risk**: If parallel validation misses critical safety signals, entire approach could be dangerous and non-regulatory compliant
- **Invalidation Test**: Compare safety signal detection on historical cases - if parallel catches <90% of sequential signals, assumption holds

- **Moderate Success**: Parallel validation achieves >90% safety signal detection with >40% time reduction  
- **Failure**: Safety signal detection drops below 85% or no significant time savings
- **Assumption Invalidated**: If failure, investigate whether specific risk stratification enables parallel approaches

**Automated Vectoring Checks**:
- Halt immediately if safety signal detection drops below 85% - safety cannot be compromised
- Monitor false positive rate - if >2x sequential rate, investigate more conservative parallel thresholds
- Track regulatory alignment - if parallel decisions conflict with actual regulatory outcomes, recalibrate approach

### Experiment 5: Human-AI Collaboration vs. Fully Automated Systems
- **Core Research Question**: Should AI systems replace human expertise or amplify it for complex medical decisions?
- **Literature Assumption**: AI Supremacy Assumption - AI systems should minimize human bias and replace expert judgment to achieve optimal outcomes
- **Assumption Flip**: Collaborative human-AI systems that amplify irreplaceable clinical expertise outperform fully automated approaches
- **Hypothesis Claim Type**: X > Y (human-AI collaboration outperforms full automation) + Bounding X (collaboration particularly valuable for complex decisions)

**Vectoring Analysis**:
- **Highest Risk**: If human experts consistently add bias or slow down decision-making without improving outcomes
