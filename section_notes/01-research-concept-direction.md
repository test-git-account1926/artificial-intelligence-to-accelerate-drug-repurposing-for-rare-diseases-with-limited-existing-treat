# Research Concept & Direction


## Overview

This research focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence to accelerate drug repurposing for rare diseases with limited existing treatment options. Traditional drug development for rare diseases is often slow and cost-prohibitive due to small patient populations and high R&D risk. AI models can analyze vast biomedical datasets—including chemical structures, omics data, clinical trial outcomes, and electronic health records—to identify approved drugs that may be effective for new indications. The objective is to build an AI-driven pipeline that rapidly screens, prioritizes, and validates repurposing candidates for specific rare diseases.

## Key Research Questions

1. Can AI models accurately predict novel therapeutic uses for existing drugs in rare disease contexts?
2. Which data modalities (e.g., molecular docking simulations, patient phenotype-genotype data, real-world treatment outcomes) provide the strongest predictive signals?
3. How can the AI’s predictions be validated efficiently through in-vitro, in-vivo, or retrospective clinical data before moving to new trials?

## Methodology

The research will be conducted in three stages:

1. **Data Integration & Model Training:** Aggregate and harmonize datasets from public sources (DrugBank, PubChem, ClinVar, OMIM), as well as de-identified clinical records. Train multimodal AI models (e.g., graph neural networks, transformer-based biomedical LMs) to predict drug–disease efficacy links.
2. **Candidate Prioritization:** Rank repurposing opportunities using multi-criteria scoring, incorporating predicted efficacy, safety profiles, and existing pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data.
3. **Preclinical Validation:** Test top candidates using in-vitro assays and disease-relevant cell or organoid models. For promising hits, conduct retrospective analysis of patient records to assess potential real-world efficacy.

The study aims to deliver a scalable AI workflow that shortens the path from hypothesis to clinical testing for rare disease treatments.
