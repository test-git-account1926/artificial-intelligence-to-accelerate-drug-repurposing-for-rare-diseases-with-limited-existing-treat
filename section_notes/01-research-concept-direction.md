# Research Concept & Direction


## Overview

This research challenges fundamental assumptions in AI-driven drug repurposing for rare diseases by proposing novel approaches that prioritize clinical actionability over predictive accuracy. While traditional drug development for rare diseases is slow and cost-prohibitive, current AI approaches make critical assumptions about data requirements, validation strategies, and the role of human expertise that may actually hinder translation to clinical practice.

**Core Research Hypothesis**: Strategically minimal, actionability-focused AI systems that amplify human expertise can outperform comprehensive, accuracy-optimized approaches for rare disease drug repurposing.

## Literature-Level Assumptions to Challenge

Based on systematic analysis of the AI drug repurposing literature, we identify ten fundamental assumptions that span multiple research efforts across computational design, evaluation methodology, and clinical translation:

### Core Computational & Data Assumptions
1. **Data Maximalism Assumption**: More comprehensive multi-modal datasets always improve repurposing predictions
2. **Accuracy-First Assumption**: Predictive accuracy is the primary success metric for AI systems
3. **Disease-Specific Modeling Assumption**: Each rare disease requires custom computational approaches
4. **Graph-Centric Architecture Assumption**: Knowledge graphs and graph neural networks are inherently superior for drug repurposing tasks
5. **AI Supremacy Assumption**: AI should minimize human bias and replace expert judgment

### Validation & Translation Assumptions
6. **Sequential Validation Assumption**: Drug validation must follow linear preclinical → clinical stages
7. **Benchmark-Centric Evaluation Assumption**: Retrospective benchmark datasets predict clinical success better than prospective validation
8. **Regulatory Pathway Universality Assumption**: AI development can operate independently of regulatory considerations
9. **Mechanistic Agnosticism Assumption**: Pattern matching without disease mechanism understanding is sufficient for clinical success
10. **Time Horizon Uniformity Assumption**: All rare diseases have similar urgency profiles and can use uniform development timelines

## Research Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Data Minimalism for Maximum Impact
- **Assumption Flip**: Prior work assumes more comprehensive datasets always improve drug repurposing predictions → We propose strategically minimal, high-signal datasets can outperform large, noisy multi-modal approaches
- **Research Question**: Can minimal but highly curated datasets achieve superior actionable predictions compared to comprehensive multi-modal approaches?
- **Impact**: Could unlock repurposing for ultra-rare conditions with extremely limited data

### Hypothesis 2: Actionability-First AI Design  
- **Assumption Flip**: Prior work assumes predictive accuracy is the primary success metric → We propose models optimized for clinical actionability (interpretability, uncertainty quantification, decision support)
- **Research Question**: Do AI systems designed for clinical actionability produce better real-world outcomes than accuracy-optimized models?
- **Impact**: Could bridge the gap between AI predictions and clinical implementation

### Hypothesis 3: Cross-Disease Pattern Learning
- **Assumption Flip**: Prior work assumes each rare disease requires disease-specific models → We propose shared mechanistic patterns across rare diseases can be leveraged through transfer learning
- **Research Question**: Can meta-learning approaches identify universal repurposing patterns that generalize across rare diseases?
- **Impact**: Could enable repurposing for diseases with insufficient individual datasets

### Hypothesis 4: Parallel Validation Strategies
- **Assumption Flip**: Prior work assumes drug validation must follow sequential preclinical → clinical stages → We propose parallel, multi-stage validation using real-world evidence
- **Research Question**: Can parallel validation approaches accelerate repurposing timelines without compromising safety?
- **Impact**: Could dramatically reduce time-to-treatment for rare disease patients

### Hypothesis 5: Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence
- **Assumption Flip**: Prior work assumes AI should minimize human bias and replace expert judgment → We propose hybrid human-AI systems that amplify clinical expertise
- **Research Question**: Do collaborative human-AI systems outperform fully automated approaches for complex repurposing decisions?
- **Impact**: Could leverage irreplaceable rare disease expertise while scaling discovery

### Hypothesis 6: Architecture Simplicity Over Graph Complexity
- **Assumption Flip**: Prior work assumes graph neural networks are inherently superior for drug repurposing → We propose simple feature-based models may achieve comparable performance with better interpretability and efficiency
- **Research Question**: Can computationally efficient, interpretable models match or exceed graph-based approaches for rare disease repurposing?
- **Impact**: Could enable faster deployment and better clinical adoption through interpretable predictions

### Hypothesis 7: Prospective Over Retrospective Validation
- **Assumption Flip**: Prior work assumes retrospective benchmark performance predicts clinical success → We propose prospective clinical validation metrics are more predictive of real-world outcomes
- **Research Question**: Do models optimized for prospective clinical metrics outperform those optimized for retrospective benchmarks?
- **Impact**: Could dramatically improve clinical translation rates by focusing on clinically relevant validation

### Hypothesis 8: Regulatory-Informed AI Design
- **Assumption Flip**: Prior work treats regulatory approval as separate from AI development → We propose AI systems designed with regulatory pathway modeling achieve higher clinical translation
- **Research Question**: Do AI systems that explicitly model regulatory requirements (Orphan Drug Designation, FDA guidance compliance) achieve superior clinical adoption?
- **Impact**: Could revolutionize clinical translatability by embedding regulatory considerations into discovery algorithms

### Hypothesis 9: Mechanistically-Grounded Predictions
- **Assumption Flip**: Prior work assumes pattern matching without mechanistic understanding is sufficient → We propose mechanistically-informed AI achieves better clinical success rates
- **Research Question**: Do AI systems that explicitly model disease pathobiology and drug mechanisms outperform purely data-driven approaches?
- **Impact**: Could ensure therapeutic rationale beyond statistical association, leading to more scientifically grounded treatments

### Hypothesis 10: Urgency-Stratified Development
- **Assumption Flip**: Prior work treats all rare diseases uniformly → We propose disease urgency stratification optimizes resource allocation and patient outcomes
- **Research Question**: Can urgency-stratified AI systems (life-threatening vs. chronic, pediatric vs. adult) achieve better overall patient outcomes?
- **Impact**: Could save more lives through appropriate prioritization and validation strategies tailored to disease urgency

## Enhanced Methodology

- **Clinical Translation Testing**: Test regulatory-informed vs. regulatory-agnostic AI design approaches
- **Mechanistic Understanding Testing**: Compare mechanistically-grounded vs. purely data-driven predictions
- **Urgency Stratification Testing**: Evaluate uniform vs. urgency-stratified development approaches

### Stage 2: Multi-Dimensional Hypothesis-Driven System Design
- **Computational Architecture**: Build hybrid simple-graph architectures optimized for interpretability and efficiency
- **Cross-Disease Learning**: Implement urgency-aware transfer learning that leverages shared mechanistic patterns
- **Regulatory Integration**: Design AI systems with embedded regulatory pathway modeling (FDA guidance compliance, Orphan Drug requirements)
- **Validation Protocols**: Develop parallel validation frameworks using real-world evidence and prospective clinical metrics
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Create interpretable decision support systems that amplify rather than replace clinical expertise

### Stage 3: Comprehensive Clinical Translation Validation
