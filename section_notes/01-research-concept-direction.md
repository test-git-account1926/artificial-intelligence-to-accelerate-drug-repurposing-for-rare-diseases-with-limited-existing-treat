## Overview

This research challenges fundamental assumptions in AI-driven drug repurposing for rare diseases by proposing novel approaches that could reshape the field. While traditional computational drug repurposing assumes that large-scale, multi-modal datasets and complex AI architectures are necessary for effective drug discovery, we hypothesize that sparse, targeted data combined with assumption-inverting methodologies may yield superior results for rare disease therapeutics.

Our core thesis inverts five literature-level assumptions that span current AI drug repurposing research, particularly for rare diseases with limited treatment options.

## Literature-Level Assumptions & Research Hypotheses

### Assumption 1: Large-Scale Data Requirements
**Literature Assumption:** AI drug repurposing requires comprehensive, large-scale datasets integrating molecular structures, omics data, clinical trials, and electronic health records to achieve meaningful predictions.

**Our Hypothesis:** Sparse, high-quality mechanistic data from small patient cohorts may outperform large-scale heterogeneous datasets for rare disease drug repurposing, particularly when combined with causal reasoning frameworks rather than correlation-based machine learning.

**Impact:** This could enable effective drug repurposing for ultra-rare diseases with <100 patients globally, where traditional big-data approaches fail.

### Assumption 2: Validation Through Clinical Data
**Literature Assumption:** AI predictions must be validated through retrospective clinical data analysis, in-vitro assays, and traditional preclinical models before clinical testing.

**Our Hypothesis:** Real-time patient outcome monitoring using wearable sensors and patient-reported outcomes during compassionate use programs can provide faster, more relevant validation than traditional preclinical models for rare diseases.

**Impact:** Could reduce validation time from years to months while providing more patient-relevant efficacy signals.

### Assumption 3: Success Metrics Based on Molecular Similarity
**Literature Assumption:** Drug repurposing success is best predicted by molecular similarity, target homology, and pathway overlap between original and new indications.

**Our Hypothesis:** Phenotypic convergence patterns—where different molecular mechanisms produce similar observable patient phenotypes—may be superior predictors of repurposing success than molecular similarity metrics.

**Impact:** Opens entirely new classes of repurposing candidates that would be missed by structure-based approaches.

### Assumption 4: Disease Mechanism Understanding Required
**Literature Assumption:** Effective drug repurposing requires well-characterized disease mechanisms and established drug-target interactions.

**Our Hypothesis:** Black-box AI models can identify effective repurposing candidates for diseases with unknown or poorly understood mechanisms by learning from patient outcome patterns rather than mechanistic understanding.

**Impact:** Enables drug discovery for the majority of rare diseases where pathophysiology remains unclear.

### Assumption 5: Individual Drug-Disease Prediction
**Literature Assumption:** AI models should predict individual drug-disease pairs and rank them by likelihood of therapeutic efficacy.

**Our Hypothesis:** Combination therapy prediction—identifying synergistic drug pairs or triplets for simultaneous repurposing—may yield dramatically superior outcomes for complex rare diseases than single-drug approaches.

**Impact:** Could address the multi-system nature of many rare diseases more effectively than current single-target paradigms.

## Research Questions

1. Can mechanistic sparsity combined with causal inference outperform big-data correlation models for rare disease drug repurposing?
2. Do phenotypic convergence patterns predict repurposing success better than molecular similarity across rare disease families?
3. Can real-time patient monitoring during compassionate use replace traditional preclinical validation for ultra-rare diseases?
4. How can AI identify effective therapies for rare diseases with completely unknown mechanisms?
5. What combination therapy discovery approaches can address the multi-system complexity of rare diseases?

## Methodology

Our methodology inverts traditional approaches at each stage:

### Stage 1: Sparse Mechanistic Modeling
Instead of aggregating massive datasets, we will:
- Identify minimal sufficient mechanistic data for each disease class
- Apply causal discovery algorithms to small, high-quality patient cohorts
- Use counterfactual reasoning to predict intervention outcomes

### Stage 2: Phenotypic Convergence Analysis
Rather than molecular similarity matching, we will:
- Map patient phenotype trajectories across different rare diseases
- Identify convergent patterns that suggest shared therapeutic vulnerabilities
- Develop phenotype-first drug matching algorithms

### Stage 3: Real-Time Validation
Replacing traditional preclinical validation with:
- Compassionate use program integration with continuous monitoring
- Patient-reported outcome collection via mobile platforms
- Adaptive trial designs that incorporate real-time efficacy signals

### Stage 4: Combination Discovery
Extending beyond single-drug predictions to:
- Multi-drug synergy prediction using network pharmacology
- Drug-drug interaction modeling for safety optimization
- Patient stratification for personalized combination therapies

## Expected Impact

If our hypothesis inversions prove correct, this research could:
- Enable drug discovery for the 95% of rare diseases currently without treatments
- Reduce time-to-therapy from decades to years for newly identified rare diseases
- Establish new paradigms for AI-driven therapeutic discovery in data-sparse environments
- Demonstrate that assumption inversion can drive breakthrough research in computational medicine

This represents a fundamental shift from assumption-dependent to assumption-challenging research in computational drug repurposing.
