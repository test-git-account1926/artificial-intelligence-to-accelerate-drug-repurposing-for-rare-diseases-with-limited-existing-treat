# Research Concept & Direction


## Overview

This research challenges fundamental assumptions in AI-driven drug repurposing for rare diseases by proposing novel approaches that prioritize clinical actionability over predictive accuracy. While traditional drug development for rare diseases is slow and cost-prohibitive, current AI approaches make critical assumptions about data requirements, validation strategies, and the role of human expertise that may actually hinder translation to clinical practice.

**Core Research Hypothesis**: Strategically minimal, actionability-focused AI systems that amplify human expertise can outperform comprehensive, accuracy-optimized approaches for rare disease drug repurposing.

## Literature-Level Assumptions to Challenge

Based on systematic analysis of the AI drug repurposing literature, we identify five fundamental assumptions that span multiple research efforts:

1. **Data Maximalism Assumption**: More comprehensive multi-modal datasets always improve repurposing predictions
2. **Accuracy-First Assumption**: Predictive accuracy is the primary success metric for AI systems
3. **Disease-Specific Modeling Assumption**: Each rare disease requires custom computational approaches
4. **Sequential Validation Assumption**: Drug validation must follow linear preclinical → clinical stages
5. **AI Supremacy Assumption**: AI should minimize human bias and replace expert judgment

## Research Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Data Minimalism for Maximum Impact
- **Assumption Flip**: Prior work assumes more comprehensive datasets always improve drug repurposing predictions → We propose strategically minimal, high-signal datasets can outperform large, noisy multi-modal approaches
- **Research Question**: Can minimal but highly curated datasets achieve superior actionable predictions compared to comprehensive multi-modal approaches?
- **Impact**: Could unlock repurposing for ultra-rare conditions with extremely limited data

### Hypothesis 2: Actionability-First AI Design  
- **Assumption Flip**: Prior work assumes predictive accuracy is the primary success metric → We propose models optimized for clinical actionability (interpretability, uncertainty quantification, decision support)
- **Research Question**: Do AI systems designed for clinical actionability produce better real-world outcomes than accuracy-optimized models?
- **Impact**: Could bridge the gap between AI predictions and clinical implementation

### Hypothesis 3: Cross-Disease Pattern Learning
- **Assumption Flip**: Prior work assumes each rare disease requires disease-specific models → We propose shared mechanistic patterns across rare diseases can be leveraged through transfer learning
- **Research Question**: Can meta-learning approaches identify universal repurposing patterns that generalize across rare diseases?
- **Impact**: Could enable repurposing for diseases with insufficient individual datasets

### Hypothesis 4: Parallel Validation Strategies
- **Assumption Flip**: Prior work assumes drug validation must follow sequential preclinical → clinical stages → We propose parallel, multi-stage validation using real-world evidence
- **Research Question**: Can parallel validation approaches accelerate repurposing timelines without compromising safety?
- **Impact**: Could dramatically reduce time-to-treatment for rare disease patients

### Hypothesis 5: Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence
- **Assumption Flip**: Prior work assumes AI should minimize human bias and replace expert judgment → We propose hybrid human-AI systems that amplify clinical expertise
- **Research Question**: Do collaborative human-AI systems outperform fully automated approaches for complex repurposing decisions?
- **Impact**: Could leverage irreplaceable rare disease expertise while scaling discovery

## Enhanced Methodology

### Stage 1: Assumption Testing Framework
- Develop controlled experiments to test each literature assumption
- Compare minimal vs. maximal data approaches on rare disease benchmarks
- Evaluate actionability metrics alongside traditional accuracy measures

### Stage 2: Hypothesis-Driven System Design
- Build AI systems designed around flipped assumptions
- Implement cross-disease transfer learning architectures
- Design parallel validation protocols using real-world evidence

### Stage 3: Clinical Translation Validation
- Partner with rare disease clinicians for human-AI collaboration studies
- Measure clinical utility and implementation success
- Validate improved time-to-treatment metrics

## Expected Impact

This research could fundamentally reshape AI drug repurposing by:
1. Establishing new evaluation frameworks focused on clinical actionability
2. Demonstrating that data minimalism can outperform data maximalism in rare diseases
3. Proving that human-AI collaboration exceeds fully automated approaches
4. Accelerating rare disease treatment development through parallel validation strategies
