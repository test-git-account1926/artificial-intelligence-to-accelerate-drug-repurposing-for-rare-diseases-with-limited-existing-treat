## Summary

Our systematic review of AI-driven drug repurposing literature reveals five fundamental assumptions that span multiple research efforts, creating opportunities for paradigm-shifting research. The analysis of 30+ recent papers (2019-2025) from ArXiv and leading journals shows a field in rapid evolution, with emerging paradigms challenging traditional assumptions about AI drug repurposing.

**Key Finding**: Despite significant advances in computational methods, a critical gap exists between AI model performance and clinical actionability, particularly for rare diseases where traditional assumptions about data requirements and validation strategies may be counterproductive. Recent 2025 research shows strong movement toward actionability-first designs, human-AI collaboration, and novel approaches to data efficiency.

## Literature-Level Assumptions Identified

Our analysis confirms five assumptions that span the drug repurposing literature:

1. **Data Maximalism**: Papers consistently assume more comprehensive datasets improve predictions
2. **Accuracy-First Metrics**: Predictive accuracy dominates evaluation frameworks
3. **Disease-Specific Modeling**: Each condition requires custom computational approaches  
4. **Sequential Validation**: Linear preclinical â†’ clinical validation is assumed optimal
5. **AI Supremacy**: Human expertise is viewed as bias to be minimized

## Cross-Paper Patterns

### Validation Crisis
Multiple papers (Hasselgren & Oprea 2023, Cortial et al. 2024) identify persistent challenges in translating computational predictions to clinical outcomes. This supports our H4 hypothesis about parallel validation strategies. Madrigal (2025) demonstrates how real-world evidence can bridge preclinical-clinical gaps.

### Interpretability Imperative  
Strong 2025 trend toward explainability: DrugAgent, K-Paths, DrugMCTS all emphasize interpretable reasoning chains over pure performance. Carbonari et al. (2025) highlight clinical utility over accuracy. This strongly supports our H2 hypothesis about actionability-first design.

### Data Efficiency Revolution
Mixed but evolving evidence: K-Paths (2025) shows 90% data reduction with maintained performance; DrugCLIP (2024) efficient learning without negative sampling; Carbonari et al. (2025) focused textual data effectiveness. However, Madrigal (2025) and BioKG Survey (2025) demonstrate multimodal integration advantages. This creates nuanced support for H1 - context and application matter.

### Collaborative Intelligence Explosion
Strongest trend in 2025 literature: DrugMCTS multi-agent collaboration, Carbonari et al. LLMs as diagnostic partners, Madrigal LLM integration, BioKG interpretable representations. Combined with established evidence (Challa et al. 2021), this provides overwhelming support for H5 hypothesis.

### LLM Integration Revolution
New 2025 pattern: Multiple papers (DrugMCTS, Carbonari et al., De Vito et al., Madrigal) demonstrate LLM integration in drug discovery. This represents paradigm shift toward natural language interfaces and human-AI collaboration in biomedical research.

## Literature Synthesis

The literature reveals a field undergoing rapid paradigm transformation. The 2025 research landscape shows decisive movement away from traditional assumptions toward actionability-first, collaborative AI approaches. While technical capabilities continue advancing, the field has recognized that clinical translation requires fundamental rethinking of core assumptions about AI drug repurposing.

**Key Evolution Patterns:**
- **2019-2022**: Focus on technical performance and accuracy optimization
- **2023-2024**: Recognition of clinical translation challenges and interpretability needs  
- **2025**: Breakthrough toward actionability-first designs, human-AI collaboration, and context-sensitive data strategies

**Hypothesis Validation Status:**
- **H1 (Data Minimalism)**: Mixed evidence - context and application determine optimal data strategy
- **H2 (Actionability-First)**: Strongly supported across multiple 2025 breakthrough papers
- **H3 (Cross-Disease Patterns)**: Literature-supported through LLM and knowledge graph approaches
- **H4 (Parallel Validation)**: Literature-supported, with real-world evidence integration emerging
- **H5 (Human-AI Collaboration)**: Strongly validated - overwhelming trend toward collaborative intelligence

**Research Positioning:**
Our research is well-positioned at the forefront of this paradigm shift. The literature validates our core insight that fundamental assumptions need challenging, particularly:

1. **Assumption Testing Framework**: 2025 literature shows field ready for systematic assumption evaluation
2. **Actionability Focus**: Strong momentum toward clinical utility over technical metrics
3. **Rare Disease Context**: Unique constraints create opportunities for novel approaches
4. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Overwhelming evidence for human-AI partnership optimization
5. **Context-Sensitive Design**: Evidence suggests optimal approaches depend on specific application contexts

**Research Gap Positioning:**
While 2025 research shows strong movement in our hypothesized directions, critical gaps remain:
- No systematic framework for testing literature-level assumptions across the field
- Limited rare disease-specific research despite unique constraints and opportunities
- Insufficient integration of parallel validation strategies with AI prediction systems
- Need for comprehensive human-AI collaboration optimization frameworks

This positions our work to make paradigm-defining contributions to AI drug repurposing, particularly for rare diseases where traditional approaches are demonstrably mismatched to clinical realities.
