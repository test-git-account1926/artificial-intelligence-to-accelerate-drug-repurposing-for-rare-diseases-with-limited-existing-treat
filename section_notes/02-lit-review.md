**Paradigm Validation**: The field has moved from theoretical proposals to **operational systems** that validate our core research hypotheses, with TxGNN deployed at txgnn.org and RareAgents outperforming GPT-4o on rare disease tasks.

## Literature-Level Assumptions Identified

Our analysis confirms five assumptions that span the drug repurposing literature:

1. **Data Maximalism**: Papers consistently assume more comprehensive datasets improve predictions
2. **Accuracy-First Metrics**: Predictive accuracy dominates evaluation frameworks
3. **Disease-Specific Modeling**: Each condition requires custom computational approaches  
4. **Sequential Validation**: Linear preclinical â†’ clinical validation is assumed optimal
5. **AI Supremacy**: Human expertise is viewed as bias to be minimized

## Cross-Paper Patterns

### Validation Crisis
Multiple papers (Hasselgren & Oprea 2023, Cortial et al. 2024) identify persistent challenges in translating computational predictions to clinical outcomes. This supports our H4 hypothesis about parallel validation strategies.

### Interpretability Imperative  
Recent work increasingly emphasizes explainability (DrugAgent, K-Paths) over pure performance metrics, supporting our H2 hypothesis about actionability-first design.

### Data Efficiency Trends
Emerging methods (K-Paths, DrugCLIP) achieve better performance with less data, challenging data maximalism assumptions and supporting our H1 hypothesis.

### Collaborative Intelligence
Growing recognition that human-AI collaboration outperforms either approach alone (Challa et al. 2021, multiple agent-based papers), strongly supporting our H5 hypothesis.
