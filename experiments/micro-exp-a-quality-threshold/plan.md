# Experiment Plan: Data Quality Threshold Detection

## Assumption
**Data Quality Threshold Assumption**: Unclear at what quality level minimal data outperforms maximal data in rare disease drug repurposing predictions.

## Hypothesis
**H-micro-A**: A specific data quality threshold exists where minimalist datasets with highly curated, relevant features consistently outperform maximalist approaches with comprehensive but noisy multi-modal data.

## Evaluation Plan

### Experimental Design
1. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Create controlled datasets with varying quality parameters
   - Noise levels: 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90% irrelevant features
   - Signal strength: High (>0.8 correlation), Medium (0.5-0.8), Low (0.2-0.5)
   - Sample sizes: 100, 500, 1000, 2500 rare disease cases per condition

2. **Model Training Strategy**
   - **Minimal Model**: <500 features, high relevance threshold (top 10% by correlation)
   - **Comprehensive Model**: >2000 features, all available data including noisy features
   - Train on synthetic rare disease drug-outcome pairs across quality spectrum

3. **Automated Evaluation**
   - Cross-validation on 10 synthetic rare diseases with known ground truth
   - Metrics: Actionable accuracy, precision at top-K predictions, clinical utility score
   - Statistical significance testing with early stopping if trends are clear

### Technical Implementation
- Use scikit-learn for baseline models, pandas for data manipulation
- Synthetic data generation based on realistic biomedical feature distributions
- Automated hyperparameter optimization for fair comparison
- Quality threshold detection using grid search and statistical validation

## Milestones

  - Create automated training orchestration

### Day 2: Automated Experimentation (8 hours)
- **Morning**: Model training across quality spectrum
  - Run experiments at 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90% noise levels
  - Train both minimal and comprehensive approaches
  - Collect performance metrics automatically
- **Afternoon**: Threshold identification
  - Statistical analysis of performance crossover points
  - Identify precise quality thresholds where minimal wins
  - Validate thresholds with bootstrap sampling

### Day 3: Analysis and Validation (8 hours)
- **Morning**: Results analysis and visualization
  - Generate performance vs quality plots
  - Statistical significance testing
  - Confidence interval calculation for thresholds
- **Afternoon**: Documentation and reporting
  - Write results summary with precise threshold values
  - Create visualizations showing crossover points
  - Validate findings with sensitivity analysis

## Success Criteria

### Strong Success (Validates Core Assumption)
- Identify precise quality threshold (e.g., >80% relevant features) where minimal data consistently outperforms comprehensive data (p < 0.01)
- Threshold remains stable across different rare disease types and sample sizes
- Performance improvement >20% at optimal quality levels

### Moderate Success (Partially Validates)
- Identify quality regions where minimal approach shows advantage (p < 0.05)
- Performance improvement >10% in favorable conditions
- Threshold varies but shows consistent pattern across conditions

### Learning from Failure
- If no clear threshold emerges, identify boundary conditions where each approach succeeds
- Document quality-performance relationships to inform future data collection strategies
- Provide guidance on when to use minimal vs comprehensive approaches

## Concrete Achievement Strategy

### Milestone Achievement Path
1. **Technical Execution**: Use automated pipelines to ensure reproducible results
2. **Statistical Rigor**: Apply proper significance testing and correction for multiple comparisons
3. **Practical Relevance**: Ensure synthetic data reflects realistic biomedical feature distributions
4. **Actionable Insights**: Provide precise numerical thresholds practitioners can apply

### Risk Mitigation
- **Data Realism**: Validate synthetic data against real biomedical datasets
- **Model Fairness**: Ensure both approaches receive equal hyperparameter optimization
- **Statistical Power**: Use adequate sample sizes to detect meaningful differences
- **Reproducibility**: Set random seeds and document all parameters

### Expected Deliverables
1. **Precise Threshold Values**: Numerical quality thresholds with confidence intervals
2. **Performance Curves**: Visualizations showing model performance vs data quality
3. **Statistical Evidence**: Significance tests and effect size measurements
4. **Practical Guidelines**: Recommendations for data collection and curation strategies
5. **Code Repository**: Reproducible implementation for future validation
