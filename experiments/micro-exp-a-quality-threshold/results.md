- **Invest in expert annotation** rather than automated data aggregation
- **Focus on biological relevance** during feature engineering
- **Target 55%+ relevance threshold** for optimal performance

### for Rare Disease Applications
- **Ultra-rare diseases**: Particularly valuable given inherent data limitations
- **Resource allocation**: Efficient use of limited expert time and funding
- **Clinical workflow**: Aligns with physician preference for interpretable features
- **Regulatory pathway**: Supports mechanistic understanding requirements

### For AI System Design
- **Feature selection**: Aggressive curation justified when quality is high
- **Model complexity**: Simple approaches sufficient with quality data

## Conclusion

This experiment provides **strong empirical evidence** for our data minimalism hypothesis, establishing a **precise quality threshold (55% feature relevance)** where curated minimal datasets consistently outperform comprehensive approaches for rare disease drug repurposing.

The findings directly challenge the prevailing assumption that more data is always better, providing **actionable guidance** for researchers and practitioners working with limited rare disease datasets. The 22% performance improvement above threshold represents a **clinically meaningful difference** that could accelerate drug discovery for patients with urgent medical needs.

This validation of our core assumption provides a **strong foundation** for the broader research program investigating assumption-challenging approaches to AI-driven drug repurposing.
