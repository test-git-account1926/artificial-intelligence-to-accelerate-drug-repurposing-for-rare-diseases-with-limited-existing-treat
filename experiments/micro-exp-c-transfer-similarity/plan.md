# Experiment Plan: Transfer Learning Similarity Mapping

## Assumption
**Disease Similarity Metric Assumption**: Unclear which disease similarity metrics best predict transfer learning success for rare disease drug repurposing.

## Hypothesis  
**H-micro-C**: Specific similarity metrics (genetic, phenotypic, molecular) correlate strongly with transfer learning effectiveness, enabling prediction of transfer learning success before expensive training.

## Evaluation Plan

### Experimental Design
1. **Disease Similarity Calculation**: Compute multiple disease similarity measures
   - Genetic overlap: Based on associated gene sets and pathways
   - Phenotypic similarity: Clinical manifestation overlap
   - Molecular pathway overlap: Biochemical pathway involvement
   - Clinical presentation similarity: Symptom and diagnosis patterns

2. **Transfer Learning Success Simulation**
   - Simulate 50 source-target disease pairs with known similarity profiles
   - Generate synthetic transfer learning outcomes based on realistic success patterns
   - Measure correlation between similarity metrics and transfer success

3. **Prediction Model Development**
   - Build regression models predicting transfer success from similarity metrics
   - Test individual metrics vs. combined models
   - Identify minimum viable similarity thresholds

### Technical Implementation
- Use scikit-learn for similarity calculations and regression modeling
- Synthetic disease similarity data based on real biomedical relationships
- Statistical correlation analysis and model validation
- Cross-validation for prediction model robustness

## Milestones

### Day 1: Similarity Metric Calculation (8 hours)
- **Morning**: Disease database setup
  - Create synthetic disease profiles with genetic, phenotypic, molecular features

  - Phenotypic similarity (cosine similarity on symptom vectors)
  - Molecular pathway overlap (pathway enrichment similarity)
  - Clinical presentation metrics (symptom pattern matching)

### Day 2-3: Transfer Learning Experiments (16 hours)
- **Day 2**: Transfer learning simulation
  - Generate 50 source-target disease pairs with varying similarity levels
  - Simulate transfer learning outcomes with realistic success patterns
  - Account for data availability, complexity, and biological relatedness
- **Day 3**: Success correlation analysis
  - Calculate correlations between each similarity metric and transfer success
  - Identify strongest predictive metrics
  - Test combined similarity models

### Day 4: Prediction Model and Analysis (8 hours)
- **Morning**: Prediction model development
  - Build regression models for transfer success prediction
  - Cross-validation and model selection
  - Identify optimal similarity thresholds
- **Afternoon**: Results analysis and validation
  - Statistical significance testing of correlations
  - Model performance evaluation
  - Sensitivity analysis and robustness checks

## Success Criteria

### Strong Success (Validates Hypothesis)
- Identify similarity metrics that predict >80% of transfer learning success cases (correlation r > 0.8, p < 0.01)
- Develop prediction model with >75% accuracy in success/failure classification
- Establish clear similarity thresholds for transfer learning viability

### Moderate Success (Partially Validates)
- Correlations >0.6 between key metrics and transfer success (p < 0.05)
- Prediction accuracy >65% with meaningful feature importance rankings
- Identify most informative similarity dimensions

### Learning from Failure  
- If no strong correlations emerge, identify which similarity metrics are uninformative
- Document boundary conditions where similarity metrics break down
- Provide guidance on alternative transfer learning selection strategies

## Concrete Achievement Strategy

### Milestone Achievement Path
1. **Realistic Simulation**: Base synthetic data on actual disease relationship patterns
2. **Statistical Rigor**: Apply proper correlation analysis and significance testing
3. **Practical Application**: Provide actionable similarity thresholds for practitioners
4. **Model Validation**: Use robust cross-validation to ensure generalizability

### Risk Mitigation
- **Data Realism**: Validate synthetic similarity patterns against real biomedical databases
- **Transfer Realism**: Base success simulation on documented transfer learning outcomes
- **Statistical Power**: Use adequate sample sizes for reliable correlation detection
- **Multiple Metrics**: Test diverse similarity approaches to avoid bias

### Expected Deliverables
1. **Similarity Metric Rankings**: Ranked importance of different similarity measures
2. **Prediction Model**: Trained model for transfer learning success prediction  
3. **Similarity Thresholds**: Numerical cutoffs for viable transfer learning
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Statistical evidence for metric-success relationships
5. **Practical Guidelines**: Recommendations for source disease selection

This experiment tests our medium-risk assumption about transfer learning similarity and provides critical guidance for optimizing cross-disease learning approaches.
