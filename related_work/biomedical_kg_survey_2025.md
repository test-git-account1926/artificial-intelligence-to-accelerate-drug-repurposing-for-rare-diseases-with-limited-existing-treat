## 6-Point Analysis Framework

### 1. Problem
Biomedical research generates vast amounts of complex data spanning molecular interactions, pharmacological insights, and clinical records. Traditional data management strategies like relational databases and rule-based systems struggle to capture the intricate and interdependent nature of biological processes, leaving valuable insights fragmented and limiting their practical impact.

### 2. Prior Assumptions
- **Relational sufficiency**: Prior work assumes traditional relational databases can adequately represent biomedical relationships
- **Domain isolation**: Traditional approaches assume different biomedical domains can be analyzed in isolation
- **Static knowledge**: Prior systems assume biomedical knowledge can be encoded as fixed relationships
- **Single-purpose design**: Previous approaches focus on specific tasks rather than unified frameworks

### 3. Insight
Biomedical Knowledge Graphs (BKGs) can provide a transformative approach by integrating diverse data sources to enable more comprehensive representation and analysis of biomedical knowledge. The key insight is that graph-based representations naturally capture the complex, interconnected nature of biological systems.

### 4. Technical Approach
- **Multi-Domain Integration**: Systematic construction from molecular interactions, pharmacological datasets, and clinical records
- **Three-Perspective Framework**: Analysis from domains, tasks, and applications perspectives
- **Knowledge Management**: Essential tasks including retrieval, reasoning, and interpretation
- **Real-World Applications**: Focus on precision medicine, drug discovery, and scientific research
- **Technological Integration**: Incorporation of modern AI advances with traditional graph methods

### 5. Evaluation
- **Systematic Review**: Comprehensive analysis of current BKG research landscape
- **Multi-Domain Coverage**: Molecular, pharmacological, and clinical applications
- **Task-Based Assessment**: Evaluation across knowledge management, retrieval, reasoning tasks
- **Application Impact**: Real-world implementation analysis in precision medicine and drug discovery
- **Framework Unification**: Integration of diverse approaches into unified conceptual framework

### 6. Impact
- **Methodological**: Establishes unified framework for understanding BKG research landscape
- **Scientific**: Enables more comprehensive biomedical knowledge integration and analysis
- **Clinical**: Supports precision medicine applications through integrated knowledge representation
- **Research**: Accelerates scientific discovery through improved knowledge organization and retrieval
- **Future Directions**: Provides foundation for next-generation biomedical AI systems
