## Analysis Framework

### Problem
- **What problem does it solve?** Limited therapeutic options for rare diseases due to small patient populations and economic constraints make traditional drug development unviable.
- **Why does it matter?** 300+ million people globally suffer from rare diseases with limited treatment options; drug repurposing offers accelerated pathway to treatment.

### Prior Assumptions
- **What did earlier work assume?**
  - Rare diseases require entirely new drug development approaches
  - Small patient populations make AI applications impossible
  - Traditional clinical trial designs are the only valid approach

### Insight  
- **What's the novel contribution?** 
  - AI can be specifically adapted for rare disease drug repurposing despite data limitations
  - Computational approaches can identify repurposing opportunities using existing data
  - Multi-modal AI approaches show promise for rare disease applications

### Technical Approach
- **How is it implemented?**
  - Systematic review of AI applications in rare disease drug repurposing
  - Analysis of machine learning methods adapted for small datasets
  - Integration of knowledge graphs and biomedical databases

### Evaluation
- **How was it validated?**
  - Comprehensive literature review methodology
  - Analysis of successful case studies in rare disease repurposing
  - Assessment of current limitations and future directions

### Impact
- **What are the implications?**
  - Establishes AI drug repurposing as viable strategy for rare diseases
  - Identifies key challenges: data scarcity, validation difficulties
  - Points toward need for specialized approaches for rare disease contexts

## Key Insights for Rare Diseases
- **Data Scarcity Challenge**: Limited patient populations create unique constraints
- **Regulatory Pathway**: Different validation requirements for rare vs common diseases  
- **Clinical Translation**: Bridging computational predictions to clinical implementation

## Relevance to Our Hypotheses
- **H1 (Data Minimalism)**: Strongly supports - rare diseases inherently have limited data
- **H3 (Cross-Disease Patterns)**: Suggests potential for shared mechanisms across rare diseases
- **H4 (Parallel Validation)**: Rare diseases may benefit from alternative validation approaches
- **Validates Core Premise**: Confirms rare diseases as important application domain for our research
