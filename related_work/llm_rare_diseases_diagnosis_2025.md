# Decoding Rarity: Large Language Models in Rare Disease Diagnosis (2025)

**Authors**: Carbonari et al.  
**ArXiv**: 2505.17065  
**Date**: May 2025  

## 6-Point Analysis Framework

### 1. Problem
Rare diseases affect millions globally but present unique diagnostic challenges due to their complexity, limited clinical expertise, and scattered knowledge across medical literature. Traditional diagnostic approaches struggle with the vast heterogeneity and limited case experience that characterizes rare disease medicine.

### 2. Prior Assumptions
- **Single-modality assumption**: Prior work assumes textual data alone is sufficient for rare disease analysis
- **Expert-only assumption**: Traditional approaches assume only human specialists can handle rare disease diagnosis
- **Static knowledge assumption**: Prior systems assume medical knowledge can be encoded in static databases

### 3. Insight
Large Language Models can leverage their extensive training on medical literature to identify patterns and support diagnostic reasoning for rare diseases. The key insight is that LLMs can serve as "intelligent conversational agents" that democratize rare disease expertise by making specialized knowledge more accessible.

### 4. Technical Approach
- **Literature Integration**: LLMs trained on comprehensive medical texts including rare disease literature
- **Conversational Interfaces**: Interactive dialogue systems for symptom collection and diagnostic reasoning
- **Pattern Recognition**: Leveraging LLM's ability to identify subtle patterns across diverse medical presentations
- **Multimodal Integration**: Framework designed for future integration of genetic, imaging, and EHR data
- **Diagnostic Questionnaires**: Structured approaches for systematic information gathering

### 5. Evaluation
- **Multiple LLMs**: Comparative analysis across different LLM architectures
- **Structured Questionnaires**: Systematic evaluation using designed diagnostic protocols
- **Disease-Specific Testing**: Evaluation across different rare disease categories
- **Qualitative Analysis**: Assessment of diagnostic reasoning quality and clinical relevance

### 6. Impact
- **Clinical Access**: Democratizes rare disease expertise, making specialized knowledge available to general practitioners
- **Diagnostic Support**: Provides structured framework for rare disease diagnostic reasoning
- **Research Acceleration**: Enables faster identification of potential rare disease cases for research
- **Future Multimodal**: Establishes foundation for comprehensive multimodal rare disease analysis platforms

## Relevance to Our Hypotheses

**Strongly Supports H5 (Human-AI Collaboration)**: LLMs designed as collaborative diagnostic partners, not replacements  
**Supports H1 (Data Minimalism)**: Demonstrates effectiveness with focused textual data rather than comprehensive multimodal datasets  
**Supports H2 (Actionability-First)**: Emphasizes clinical utility and diagnostic support over pure accuracy metrics  
**Addresses H3 (Cross-Disease Patterns)**: LLMs can identify patterns across rare disease presentations

## Key Technical Contributions
1. First comprehensive survey of LLMs applied to rare disease diagnosis
2. Framework for conversational diagnostic interfaces in rare diseases
3. Structured approach to LLM evaluation in medical diagnostic tasks
4. Roadmap for multimodal integration in rare disease platforms

## Critical Gaps Identified
- Privacy and ethical considerations in deploying LLMs for medical diagnosis
- Need for robust, inclusive training datasets representing rare disease diversity
- Limited real-world clinical validation of LLM diagnostic capabilities
- Challenges in model transparency and explainability for clinical use

## Clinical Translation Challenges
- Regulatory approval pathways for LLM-based diagnostic tools
- Integration with existing clinical workflows and EHR systems
- Training requirements for healthcare providers using LLM diagnostic tools
- Quality assurance and continuous monitoring of LLM diagnostic performance
