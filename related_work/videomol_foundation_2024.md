## 6-Point Research Analysis Framework

### 1. Problem
Accurate molecular representation of compounds is a fundamental challenge for prediction of drug targets and molecular properties, with traditional approaches limited by:
- Static molecular representations missing dynamic conformational information
- Limited capture of three-dimensional molecular structure
- Inadequate representation learning for complex molecular properties
- Poor performance in identifying antiviral molecules and drug-target interactions

### 2. Prior Assumptions in Prior Work

- **2D Structure Focus**: Molecular properties can be predicted primarily from 2D chemical structures
- **Single-Frame Analysis**: Molecular understanding doesn't require temporal/dynamic information
- **Limited Self-Supervision**: Molecular representation learning requires extensive labeled data

### 3. Key Insight/Novel Contribution
