## 6-Point Research Analysis Framework

### 1. Problem
Rare diseases affect millions globally but face significant drug discovery challenges:
- Limited patient populations making clinical trials difficult and expensive
- Insufficient research investment due to small market size
- Complex disease mechanisms requiring multi-modal data integration
- Lack of explainable AI systems for clinical decision-making in rare diseases
- Need for interpretable drug repurposing recommendations

### 2. Prior Assumptions in Prior Work
- **Black-Box Sufficiency**: AI drug repurposing systems don't need to be explainable for clinical use
- **Single-Modal Analysis**: Drug repurposing can be effectively done with single data types
- **Common Disease Methods**: Approaches developed for common diseases work equally well for rare diseases
- **Technical Metrics Priority**: Predictive accuracy is more important than clinical interpretability
