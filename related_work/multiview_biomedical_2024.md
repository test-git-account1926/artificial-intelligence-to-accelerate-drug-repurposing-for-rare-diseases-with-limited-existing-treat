## Summary

**Problem**: Previous molecular foundation models typically focus on single representations (graph, image, or text), limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of molecular systems.

**Assumption in Prior Work**: Single-modal molecular representations are sufficient for drug discovery tasks; separate models needed for different molecular views.

**Insight**: Integrating multiple molecular views (graph, image, text) into unified foundation models can balance strengths and weaknesses of specific representations, achieving superior performance.

**Technical Overview**:
- Multi-view foundation model integrating molecular graphs, images, and text
- Single-view models pre-trained on up to 200M molecules
- Views aggregated into combined representations
- Validated on 18 diverse tasks (ligand-protein binding, solubility, metabolism, toxicity)

**Proof**: 
- Multi-view models demonstrate robust performance across diverse tasks
- Successfully balance strengths/weaknesses of individual molecular views
- Strong performance on G Protein-Coupled receptor (GPCR) screening (>100 targets)
- Superior generalization across different molecular property prediction tasks

**Impact**: Establishes multi-view learning as superior approach for molecular foundation models, potentially revolutionizing how molecular AI systems integrate diverse data modalities.

## Relevance to Our Research

**Strong Validation of Multiple Hypotheses**:
- **H6 (Architecture Innovation)**: Novel multi-view architecture outperforms single-modal approaches
- **H1 (Data Minimalism)**: Strategic integration of complementary views more effective than comprehensive single-modal data
- **H3 (Cross-Disease Patterns)**: Multi-view approach enables better cross-target generalization
- **H2 (Actionability-First)**: Focus on practical drug discovery applications (GPCR screening)

**Key Insights**:
1. **Complementary Information**: Different molecular views capture complementary information
2. **Robust Performance**: Multi-view models more stable across diverse tasks
3. **Scalability**: Approach scales to large molecular databases (200M molecules)
4. **Clinical Relevance**: GPCR screening directly relevant to drug repurposing

**Connection to Drug Repurposing**:
- Multi-view approach ideal for drug repurposing where diverse molecular information needed
- GPCR targets highly relevant for rare disease therapeutics
- Demonstrates feasibility of unified molecular foundation models
- Validates our hypothesis about architectural innovation over complexity

**Literature-Level Impact**:
- Challenges single-modal molecular representation assumptions
- Establishes multi-view learning paradigm for molecular AI
- Shows that strategic data integration outperforms data maximalism

## Notes
- 200M molecule scale demonstrates industrial-level applicability
- Multi-view integration addresses key limitation of existing molecular AI
- GPCR screening results directly relevant to drug repurposing applications
- Validates our architectural innovation hypothesis with concrete performance gains
