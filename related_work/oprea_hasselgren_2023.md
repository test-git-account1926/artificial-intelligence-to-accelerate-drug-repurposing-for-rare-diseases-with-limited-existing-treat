## Analysis Framework

### Problem
- **What problem does it solve?** Despite significant AI advances, questions remain about actual impact on drug discovery outcomes and clinical translation.
- **Why does it matter?** AI adoption is accelerating, but reproducibility crisis and translation challenges persist.

### Prior Assumptions
- **What did earlier work assume?**
  - More AI/data automatically leads to better drug discovery outcomes
  - Technical performance metrics translate to clinical success
  - AI can replace traditional drug discovery approaches entirely

### Insight
- **What's the novel contribution?**
  - Critical assessment of AI's actual vs. promised impact in drug discovery
  - Identification of persistent challenges: reproducibility, ground truth validation
  - Emphasis on need for human intervention at critical pipeline stages

### Technical Approach
- **How is it implemented?**
  - Comprehensive review of AI applications across drug discovery pipeline
  - Analysis of generative chemistry, machine learning, multi-property optimization
  - Assessment of compounds that entered clinical trials through AI assistance

### Evaluation
- **How was it validated?**
  - Review of AI-driven compounds entering clinical trials
  - Analysis of reproducibility challenges in published AI research
  - Assessment of ground truth quality in training datasets

### Impact
- **What are the implications?**
  - AI shows promise but faces significant validation challenges
  - Human expertise remains critical for clinical translation
  - Need for better evaluation frameworks focused on clinical outcomes

## Critical Insights
- **Reproducibility Crisis**: Many AI drug discovery results cannot be replicated
- **Ground Truth Problem**: Training data quality significantly impacts real-world performance
- **Clinical Translation Gap**: Technical metrics don't predict clinical success
- **Human Intervention**: Still required at later pipeline stages for success

## Relevance to Our Hypotheses
- **H2 (Actionability-First)**: Supports need for clinically-focused evaluation metrics
- **H5 (Human-AI Collaboration)**: Validates importance of human intervention
- **Challenges Data Maximalism**: More data/AI doesn't automatically improve outcomes
- **Validation Challenges**: Highlights need for alternative evaluation approaches (supports H4)
