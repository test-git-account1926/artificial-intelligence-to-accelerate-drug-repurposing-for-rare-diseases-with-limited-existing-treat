Minimal: 0.78±0.05 vs Comprehensive: 0.72±0.04 AUC above threshold.","notes":"Core assumption validated - quality beats quantity above 55% relevance threshold. Challenges data maximalism assumption in AI drug repurposing literature. Provides actionable guidance for rare disease research.","dataFiles":"data/micro-exp-a-results/","codeRepo":"experiments/micro-exp-a-quality-threshold/","createdDate":"2025-08-14T17:25:00.000Z"}
