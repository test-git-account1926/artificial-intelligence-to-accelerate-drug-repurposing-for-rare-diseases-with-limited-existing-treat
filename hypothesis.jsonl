{"id":"h1_sparse_data","assumption":"AI drug repurposing requires comprehensive, large-scale datasets integrating molecular structures, omics data, clinical trials, and electronic health records to achieve meaningful predictions","hypothesis":"Sparse, high-quality mechanistic data from small patient cohorts may outperform large-scale heterogeneous datasets for rare disease drug repurposing, particularly when combined with causal reasoning frameworks rather than correlation-based machine learning","impact":"Could enable effective drug repurposing for ultra-rare diseases with <100 patients globally, where traditional big-data approaches fail","timestamp":"2025-08-12T22:52:45.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"h2_realtime_validation","assumption":"AI predictions must be validated through retrospective clinical data analysis, in-vitro assays, and traditional preclinical models before clinical testing","hypothesis":"Real-time patient outcome monitoring using wearable sensors and patient-reported outcomes during compassionate use programs can provide faster, more relevant validation than traditional preclinical models for rare diseases","impact":"Could reduce validation time from years to months while providing more patient-relevant efficacy signals","timestamp":"2025-08-12T22:52:45.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"h3_phenotypic_convergence","assumption":"Drug repurposing success is best predicted by molecular similarity, target homology, and pathway overlap between original and new indications","hypothesis":"Phenotypic convergence patterns—where different molecular mechanisms produce similar observable patient phenotypes—may be superior predictors of repurposing success than molecular similarity metrics","impact":"Opens entirely new classes of repurposing candidates that would be missed by structure-based approaches","timestamp":"2025-08-12T22:52:45.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"h4_mechanism_agnostic","assumption":"Effective drug repurposing requires well-characterized disease mechanisms and established drug-target interactions","hypothesis":"Black-box AI models can identify effective repurposing candidates for diseases with unknown or poorly understood mechanisms by learning from patient outcome patterns rather than mechanistic understanding","impact":"Enables drug discovery for the majority of rare diseases where pathophysiology remains unclear","timestamp":"2025-08-12T22:52:45.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"h5_combination_therapy","assumption":"AI models should predict individual drug-disease pairs and rank them by likelihood of therapeutic efficacy","hypothesis":"Combination therapy prediction—identifying synergistic drug pairs or triplets for simultaneous repurposing—may yield dramatically superior outcomes for complex rare diseases than single-drug approaches","impact":"Could address the multi-system nature of many rare diseases more effectively than current single-target paradigms","timestamp":"2025-08-12T22:52:45.000Z","status":"proposed"}
